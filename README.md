# Connect-Four

CS 4100 Artificial Intelliegence
March 2023

This assignment builds up to the creation of an interactive game of Connect Four against a bot that aims to find the best and most intelligent move. I start by construcuting a player that chooses a random board position as its move, and eventually build up to the intelligent player which implements the minMax algorithm.
